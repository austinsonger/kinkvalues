The assignment of values (the `effect` object with attributes like `attract`, `drive`, `dominant`, `deviance`, or `affect`) is subjective and depends on the meaning or intent of each question. Here's the logic I used to determine how each question is assigned a value:

### **1\. Understanding the Categories & Context-Driven Mapping:**

* **Attract**: Questions about attraction to specific traits (e.g., "confidence, charisma, and personality") are assigned values reflecting alignment with diverse attraction preferences. Positive values are assigned for questions that broaden attraction to these traits.  
* **Drive**: Questions about libido, masturbation, or an overwhelming sexual urge directly map to higher `drive` values, while indifference or repulsion decreases it.  
* **Dominant**: Questions about taking charge or commanding behavior align positively with dominance, while enjoying submission or preferring equality leads to neutral or negative effects.  
* **Deviance**: Questions exploring unconventional or taboo sexual interests are assigned positive values for `deviance`. Discomfort with experimentation reflects negative values.  
* **Affect**: Questions addressing emotional connections or stress relief through intimacy positively affect `affect`, while focus on purely physical pleasure or casual encounters reduces it.

### **2\. Interpreting the Questions:**

Each question is read carefully to determine:

* **What it is evaluating:** Does the question relate to attraction, libido, dominance, deviance, or emotional impact of sex?  
* **How it affects the trait:** Does it indicate a positive or negative inclination, or is it neutral?

### **3\. Assigning Values:**

* **Positive values:** (+1, \+2) indicate a strong or affirming response to the trait in question.  
* **Negative values:** (-1, \-2) suggest a negation, disinterest, or aversion to the trait.  
* **Neutral values:** (0) indicate a balanced or indifferent response to the trait.

#### **Example Logic:**

* **Attract:**  
  * "I find myself more drawn to confidence, charisma, and personality over physical appearance."  
    → **Value: 1 for attract**  
    This question suggests a strong preference for personality traits over physical appearance, which relates positively to `attract`.  
  * "I could imagine myself in a sexual scenario with someone older or younger than me."  
    → **Value: 0 for attract**  
    This question reflects a neutral stance—it's not indicating a specific attraction but openness to possibilities.  
* **Drive:**  
  * "I find great pleasure in the thought of masturbating."  
    → **Value: 1 for drive**  
    This reflects an increased libido or sexual interest.  
  * "I am likely to disregard boundaries if a partner initiates intimacy at the wrong time or place."  
    → **Value: \-1 for drive**  
    This question indicates difficulty controlling urges, which may negatively impact self-regulation or boundaries.  
* **Dominant:**  
  * "I prefer taking charge and making decisions regarding sex in a relationship."  
    → **Value: 1 for dominant**  
    This clearly aligns with a dominant personality preference.  
* **Deviance:**  
  * "I am fascinated by certain aspects of fetishism or bondage, even though I’ve never tried them."  
    → **Value: 1 for deviance**  
    Indicates openness and curiosity about non-mainstream behaviors.  
* **Affect:**  
  * "I find sexual activity to be an effective way to relieve stress and anxiety."  
    → **Value: 1 for affect**  
    Suggests a positive emotional or stress-relieving association with sexual activity.  
  * "I am usually aroused by visual stimuli or explicit conversation rather than emotional cues."  
    → **Value: \-1 for affect**  
    Indicates a preference for physical or explicit stimuli over emotional connection, detracting from the `affect` category.

### **4\. Balancing Traits Across the Spectrum**

To create a balanced representation:

* **Varied Effects**: Not all questions align perfectly with the extreme ends of a trait. Some are assigned neutral or weaker values to ensure nuanced results.  
* **Opposing Traits**: For some categories, certain behaviors oppose the trait (e.g., aversion to dominance or intimacy), resulting in negative effects.
    

### **Example Assignments:**

| Question | Category | Effect Rationale |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| "I often fantasize about role-playing and costumes." | `attract` | Role-playing suggests creativity and attraction to novelty, assigned `+1`. |
| "I masturbate at least once a day." | `drive` | High libido aligns with increased drive, assigned `+1`. |
| "I feel immensely excited by the idea of command." | `dominant` | Clear alignment with dominance, assigned `+1`. |
| "I consider myself vanilla." | `deviance` | Opposes deviance; preference for simplicity or norms, assigned `-2`. |
| "I notice self-esteem fluctuations based on praise." | `affect` | Emotional influence suggests higher affect sensitivity, assigned `+1`. |

### **5\. Edge Cases:**

For ambiguous questions (e.g., involving taboo topics or mixed emotional contexts), I leaned on a cautious assignment:

* Avoided extreme positive or negative values unless the context was clear.  
* For openness without action (e.g., "intrigued but do not necessarily want to act"), assigned smaller positive values to the corresponding trait.
