The assignment of values (the `effect` object with attributes like `attract`, `drive`, `dominant`, `deviance`, or `affect`) is subjective and depends on the meaning or intent of each question. Here's the logic I used to determine how each question is assigned a value:

### **1\. Understanding the Categories:**

* **Attract:** Measures preferences or interests in certain traits, scenarios, or personalities that make someone feel drawn to another person.  
* **Drive:** Relates to libido, frequency, or intensity of sexual thoughts, actions, and desires.  
* **Dominant:** Relates to preferences for control, power dynamics, or submissiveness in sexual or intimate relationships.  
* **Deviance:** Measures openness or curiosity about non-mainstream sexual behaviors or fetishes.  
* **Affect:** Measures emotional or stress-related aspects of sexual activity and its importance relative to physical or emotional cues.

### **2\. Interpreting the Questions:**

Each question is read carefully to determine:

* **What it is evaluating:** Does the question relate to attraction, libido, dominance, deviance, or emotional impact of sex?  
* **How it affects the trait:** Does it indicate a positive or negative inclination, or is it neutral?

### **3\. Assigning Values:**

* **Positive values:** (+1, \+2) indicate a strong or affirming response to the trait in question.  
* **Negative values:** (-1, \-2) suggest a negation, disinterest, or aversion to the trait.  
* **Neutral values:** (0) indicate a balanced or indifferent response to the trait.

#### **Example Logic:**

* **Attract:**  
  * "I find myself more drawn to confidence, charisma, and personality over physical appearance."  
    → **Value: 1 for attract**  
    This question suggests a strong preference for personality traits over physical appearance, which relates positively to `attract`.  
  * "I could imagine myself in a sexual scenario with someone older or younger than me."  
    → **Value: 0 for attract**  
    This question reflects a neutral stance—it's not indicating a specific attraction but openness to possibilities.  
* **Drive:**  
  * "I find great pleasure in the thought of masturbating."  
    → **Value: 1 for drive**  
    This reflects an increased libido or sexual interest.  
  * "I am likely to disregard boundaries if a partner initiates intimacy at the wrong time or place."  
    → **Value: \-1 for drive**  
    This question indicates difficulty controlling urges, which may negatively impact self-regulation or boundaries.  
* **Dominant:**  
  * "I prefer taking charge and making decisions regarding sex in a relationship."  
    → **Value: 1 for dominant**  
    This clearly aligns with a dominant personality preference.  
* **Deviance:**  
  * "I am fascinated by certain aspects of fetishism or bondage, even though I’ve never tried them."  
    → **Value: 1 for deviance**  
    Indicates openness and curiosity about non-mainstream behaviors.  
* **Affect:**  
  * "I find sexual activity to be an effective way to relieve stress and anxiety."  
    → **Value: 1 for affect**  
    Suggests a positive emotional or stress-relieving association with sexual activity.  
  * "I am usually aroused by visual stimuli or explicit conversation rather than emotional cues."  
    → **Value: \-1 for affect**  
    Indicates a preference for physical or explicit stimuli over emotional connection, detracting from the `affect` category.

### **4\. Edge Cases:**

For ambiguous questions (e.g., involving taboo topics or mixed emotional contexts), I leaned on a cautious assignment:

* Avoided extreme positive or negative values unless the context was clear.  
* For openness without action (e.g., "intrigued but do not necessarily want to act"), assigned smaller positive values to the corresponding trait.
